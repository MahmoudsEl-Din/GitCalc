# GitCalc - Simple C++ Calculator

## Project Overview
GitCalc is a minimalistic calculator program developed in C++. It's capable of executing five fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. This project is tailored for beginners seeking to delve into the basics of C++ programming, as well as for those interested in understanding the essentials of Git version control in a real-world project context.

## Features
- **Addition**: Add two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtract one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply two numbers.
- **Division**: Divide one number by another, with division-by-zero handling.
- **Modulus**: Calculate the remainder of division between two integers.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Execute `git clone https://github.com/MahmoudsEl-Din/GitCalc.git` in your terminal.

2. **Navigate to the Repository Folder**:  
   Change directory using `cd GitCalc`.

3. **Compile the Program**:  
   Ensure you have a C++ compiler (such as g++). Compile the program with:
